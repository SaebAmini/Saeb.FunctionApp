# What is it?

A custom Azure Function .NET Core template with dependency injection, integration testing, YAML build pipeline and file based settings set up, so you can just `dotnet new` and start creating awesome Azure Function apps!

# How do I use it?

Download this repo to a folder, then install it as a .NET Core Template via this command:

```
dotnet new -i \path\to\folder
```

You can then create a new project based on the template:

```
dotnet new functionapp -n NameOfYourProject
```
